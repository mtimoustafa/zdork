                     Standing atop a hill, you take in the expanse of a desolate desert stretching in all directions.
                     The dry air's heat is dwarfed by that of the beating sun's.

                     A strange shimmer can be seen to the WEST. A mirage?
                     A tall black obelisk pierces the horizon to the EAST.
                     To the SOUTH, a strange whisper emanates.
